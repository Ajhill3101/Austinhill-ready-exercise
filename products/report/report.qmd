*This was practice data that was made up for educational purposes*


# Methods

*Simple analysis of data with 5 variables. Height, Weight, Gender, Age, Hair color.*

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```

# Results
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table. All caption text goes here."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable <- readRDS(here::here("results", "tables", "summarytable.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis


```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
# height vs Hair color boxplot
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-by-haircolor-boxplot.png"))
# weight vs age scatter plot
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","weight-by-age-scatter.png"))
```

## Full analysis

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable1 and tbl-resulttable2 and tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable1 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable1.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable1)
resulttable2 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
resulttable3 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```
